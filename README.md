# DerivBaseRu

An algorithm for building a derivational morphology resourse for Russian. It is based on the rules described in "The Russian Grammar" book and includes the most productive types of derivation in Russian.

The work on this project is in progress. For now, our system includes derivation rules for nouns, adjectives, and (partly) verbs.
